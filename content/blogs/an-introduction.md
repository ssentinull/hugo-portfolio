## Hello There.

My name is Ibnu Ahsani, a Computer Science fresh graduate from Jakarta, Indonesia.

Welcome dear reader to this simple website!

The intention behind this was to replace my old, single-paged, web portfolio built back when I was still in college. Now that I've graduated college, I feel that a revamp is necessary. So, here we are. My plan for this site was never to build anything fancy. I just wanted a place where I could display my career-relevant information as well as my previous projects. I also want to dip my hands in some light blogging.

If you have any inquiry, feel free to reach me through my personal email listed in the footer of this site or mentioned in the About page.

Thank you for taking your time to read this article.
