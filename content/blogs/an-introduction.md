## Hello. :wave:

My name is Ibnu Ahsani, a Software Engineer from Jakarta, Indonesia. :indonesia:

Welcome, dear readers, to my simple website! :raising_hand_man:

The purpose behind this site is to replace my old, single-page web portfolio that I built back when I was still in college. Now that I'm four years into my career in the tech industry, I felt it was time for a revamp. So, here we are. My plan for this site was never to create anything too fancy â€” I just wanted a space to showcase my career-relevant information as well as my previous side projects. I also want to try my hand at some light blogging.

If you have any inquiries, feel free to reach out to me through my personal email listed in the footer of this site or on the About page.

Thank you for visiting my site. :pray:
