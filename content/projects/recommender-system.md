## Description.

The premis behind this web-app is quite simple: the user would input the abstract for their scientific article (written in Bahasa Indonesia), and the application will output which journal it suits best based on similarities found in the abstract compared to the journals. The application is able to do this because of it relies on a previously trained Softmax-Regression model that's deployed to the website.

The Softmax-Regression model is trained on

This project is actually my Bachelor's Thesis project. As I was casually browsing through the internet to find journals that I could use for inspiration, I came across a [feature](https://journalfinder.elsevier.com/) from [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/en-xs) that allows researchers to find the best journals that fit their scientific paper. After searching whether there was an Indonesian counterpart or not avaliable online (which there wasn't at that time), and knowing that my major's specialization was Artificial Intelligence, I picked this idea to be my Bachelor's Thesis project.
