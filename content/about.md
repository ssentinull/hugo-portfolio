My name is Ibnu Ahsani, a Software Engineer from Jakarta, Indonesia.

I currently have four years of professional experience, focusing on backend technologies across a wide range of business domains, including commerce, media, and anti-fraud.

I'm currently emplyed at [eFishery](https://efishery.com) on the Trust team, which deals with anti-fraud. My responsibilities include creating systems to prevent and mitigate fraudulent transactions within the eFishery ecosystem.
