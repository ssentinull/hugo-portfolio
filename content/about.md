My name is Ibnu Ahsani, a Sofware Engineer from Jakarta, Indonesia. I graduated college in 2020 and have Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from [Padjadjaran University](https://www.unpad.ac.id/). As of 2021, I have less than 1 year of experience under my belt, so technically that still makes me a Fresh Graduate hehe :)

I'm currently working as a Backend Engineer at [kiddo.id](https://kiddo.id/). My tasks are to create a Content Management system, as well as maintain, and improve their Marketplace system. The language that I use in my workplace, also the language that I'm most familiar with at the moment, is Golang.

Over the years of studying in college, working as an intern as well as a full-timer, I've accumulated a few skillsets and learned how to use some tools. Here are all the skillsets and tools that I know and have obtained so far, listed according to my level of expertise:

- Intermediate: Git, Golang, Echo, Typescript, NodeJs, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Queries, REST API.
- Basic: Python, Java, Javascript, Flask, ExressJs, MochaJs, MongoDB, ORM, NoSQL Queries, Heroku, Linux OS, System Design.
